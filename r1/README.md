# Basic UNIX usage

Most of you are used to interacting with computers and smartphones by GUI and
the touch interface.  As a developer / programmer / hacker / advanced user, you
can do your job more efficient by mastering the commandline interface.  In
UNIX, most of the interesting things you do occur by using and combining
various commands.  

Your lab virtual machine is a Linux box.  Your MacOS laptop is based on BSD
UNIX.  So the UNIX commands you learn apply to both mostly identically but have 
some small variations.

Please read this [ guide on using UNIX commands ](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line).
Below is a short list of the most basic commands you will typically use on a day to day basis:

* `man`
* `ls`
* `cd`
* `pwd`
* `grep`
* `less`
* `wc`
* | and >
* `find`
* `ctrl-c`
* `ctrl-z`
* `tar`
* `curl`
* `apt-get install` (Not on Mac)
* `apt-cache search` (Not on Mac)

Despite attending this recitation, many times you will have questions about ``how do I do this?" 
"is there a command for doing X?".  The answer to all of these questions can usually 
be answered by Googling.  Stackoverflow has many helpful answers.

## Exercises

* Using commandline only, download the source code of Nginx web server. The code's URL is at here: http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.9.2.tar.gz

* Using commandline only, figure out how many C source files there are in Nginx's codebase. C source files have filenames that end of `.c` suffix.

* Using commandline only, find out which C source file contains the `main` function for Nginx.
